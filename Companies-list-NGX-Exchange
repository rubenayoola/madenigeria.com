Another important aspect is that the president of the Senate Committee on Capital Markets and Institutions, Senator Osita Izunaso, said that there was a legislative agenda that required NNPC Limited to be listed on the stock market.</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited</h3><div><div><a href="https://www.indoramaeleme.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited</strong></a> is a Nigerian company based in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. This company is part of the Group Company of Indorama Corporation. The company is a polyolefin producer of a range of polyethylene and polypropylene products. It has a production capacity of 360KT of polyethylene and 120 KT of polypropylene per year.</div><div>Previously, the company was a subsidiary of NNPC, but due to the poor productivity of the plant, it was privatized, selling the plant to Indorama. The company, since then, under the management of Indorama, has more than 1,200 employees and exports polymer products to several countries, both on the African continent, as well as in Europe, Asia and the United States.</div><div>Recently, the Public Enterprises Bureau revealed that it would list Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited on NGX, as part of the privatization programme, which would further improve the transparency of the company and allow Nigerians to obtain some share in the company.</div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dangote Petroleum Refinery</strong></h3><div><div>Dangote Refinery is an oil refinery in Lekki, Nigeria, owned by the Dangote Group. It is the largest single-train refinery in the world, with a processing capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</div><div>The refinery began operating in January 2024. And it has begun producing diesel and jet fuel. Production is expected to expand to other refined products in the future. The refinery is also expected to help Nigeria achieve self-sufficiency in refined petroleum products and eliminate dependence on imports. The refinery also aims to export refined products to other countries in Africa and the world. It is estimated that the refinery has created 30,000 direct and indirect jobs.</div><div>On the other hand, Dangote stated that he intended to list the refinery on both the NGX Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.</div></div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Nigeria Reinsurance Corporation Plc</strong></h3><div><div>According to a report by Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited, an investment management holding company, several companies will be listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited, Nigeria's main stock exchange. Among the companies mentioned in the report was&nbsp;<strong>Nigeria Reinsurance Corporation Plc.</strong>, a Nigerian reinsurer that began operating in Nigeria on January 1, 1978 as a company wholly owned by the Nigerian Government. Later, in 2002, the Government privatized the company, retaining only some shares.</div><div>On the other hand, what stands out about this company is that it is not a limited company but a public company, as listed in the Corporate Affairs Commission. Another piece of information that cannot go unnoticed is that the Bureau of Public Enterprises reported that it would sell the company through an IPO. All these indications make it clear that Nigeria Reinsurance Corporation Plc. will most likely list on the NGX Exchange this year.</div></div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Transcorp Power Plc</h3><div><div><a href="https://transcorppower.com/" target="_blank">Transcorp Power Plc.</a> is a Nigerian subsidiary of <a href="https://transcorpgroup.com/" target="_blank">Transnational Corparation Plc.</a>, an NGX-listed conglomerate. Transcorp Power operates both the Ughelli power plant, a gas-fired power plant with a capacity of 972 MV, and the Afam power plant, another gas-fired power plant with a capacity of 966 MV. Additionally, in August 2023, through a consortium led by Transcorp Power, it acquired 60 % of the distributor <a href="https://www.abujaelectricity.com/" target="_blank">Abuja Electricity Distribution Company Plc.</a></div><div>Nigerian Exchange Group announced that Transcorp Power Plc would list on the NGX on March 4, 2023.</div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3><div><div>Finally, Made in Nigeria draws the conclusion that the listing of the companies mentioned above could be very beneficial for both the Nigerian economy and the capital market, more specifically for NGX Group and Nasd Plc.</div><div>The listing of for example NNPC Limited to NGX could improve the company's transparency and productivity. In the purest style of Aramco with its listing on the Saudi Exchange.</div></div></div>
